# My Portfolio ðŸš€

This is my portfolio repository, showcasing my skills and experience in web development. Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, along with demonstrations of my abilities in various technologies.

## Getting Started

This repository is a React application. To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized using a component-based structure. Here's a breakdown of the key folders:

*   `src`: This directory contains the source code for the React application.
    *   `components`: Reusable UI components for building the portfolio layout and functionality.
    *   `pages`: Individual pages for different sections of the portfolio (e.g., About, Projects, Contact, Blog).
    *   `styles`: Global and component-specific styles using styled-components.
    *   `App.tsx`: The main application entry point.
*   `public`: This directory contains static assets like images, fonts, or favicons.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **React Router:** A routing library for managing navigation within the React application.
*   **styled-components:** A library for creating styled components with CSS-in-JS.
*   **React Icons:** For using icons in the project.

## Deployment

This portfolio is easily deployable to platforms like Vercel or Netlify for automatic deployments on every git push. It can also be deployed to Github pages, but that requires manual updating.

## Contributing
